# GeoBibli
GeoBibli (for the library and API project)
Find your favorite books that are set anywhere in this world and find markers on a map that correlate to scenes in the book. 
Currently, you can click through 3 New York Times best selling novels and see some examples of correlating points within those books.
You can also search for any book you would like and see which books we have available on the map, which are indicated by underlined text.
In the future, you will be able to fully customize your own bookshelf with different books, make custom trips, and share your shelf or trips with friends.

you can access GeoBibli at vast-geese.surge.sh

Lessons Learned:
-markers are kind of tricky to unmake or remove
-I learned how to google css stuff pretty well
-I learned a bit more about variable scoping
-I am getting better at trouble shooting and reading errors
