        <p class="content">Users would upload or add to their bookshelf (maybe potentially by linking their GoodReads account). Each book, if set in the real world, would have a collection of iconic (either in the book or in the real world) places that the user could see on a map. 
            <br> The pop ups would have the book title, page number, and brief summary of the significance of that setting. This leaves room for some cool features where users could plan trips based on their favorite books, add comments or pictures to share with the community, etc.
            <br> The user would have a "shelf" of books. They can click on a book to 'open book' which would populate any tags associated with the book. Ideally more than one book could be open at a time and the user would be able to make custom trips based on the markers in their favorite books.
